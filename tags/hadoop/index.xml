      <description>Backgrounds This is the link from WikiMedia about what’s Speculative Execution. In Hadoop, the following parameters string are for this settings. And, they are true by default.
mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution  When to Disable Most time, it helps. However, I am here to collect some scenario when we do not need it.
 Of course, when ever your cluster really in shortage of resource or for the purpose of experiment, we can disable them by setting them to false since “SE” really a big resource consumer It is generally advisable to turn off ”SE” for mapred jobs that use HBase as a source.</description>
